Home Security Project contains face recognition, fire detection and motion detection\
Face Detection:\
Fire Detection: Uses OpenCV \
Motion Detection: Uses OpenCV, with whatsapp integration using twillio \
Smart Door/Window: Includes a circuit created using ESP8266 and MPU6050, which is integrated with a C code written on Arduino IDE.\
\
The project also includes a simulation of gas detector. All the components are to be combined together through an application interface.
