# Secure-Automated-Smart-Home
#### *This project integrates face recognition, fire detection, and motion detection into a comprehensive home security system. The system uses OpenCV for image processing, WhatsApp integration via Twilio for alerts, and a smart door/window mechanism with ESP8266 and MPU6050 sensors.*
**Face Detection**
Technology: OpenCV\
Description: Detects faces from live video feed and compares them with an existing database to recognize known individuals.\
**Motion Detection**
Technology: OpenCV\
Description: Senses motion using video feed. Integrated with WhatsApp via Twilio to send alerts when motion is detected.\
**Smart Door/Window**
Components: ESP8266, MPU6050\
Description: Uses a circuit to monitor door/window status. The hardware is programmed using Arduino IDE with C code.\
