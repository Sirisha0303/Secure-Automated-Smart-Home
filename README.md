# Secure-Automated-Smart-Home
#### *This project integrates face recognition, fire detection, and motion detection into a comprehensive home security system. The system uses OpenCV for image processing, WhatsApp integration via Twilio for alerts, and a smart door/window mechanism with ESP8266 and MPU6050 sensors.*\
**Face Detection**: Uses OpenCV to detect frames from the live video and compare it with the existing database to recognise faces\
**Motion Detection**: Uses OpenCV to sense motion and includes whatsapp integration using twillio \
**Smart Door/Window**: Includes a circuit created using ESP8266 and MPU6050, which is integrated with a C code written on Arduino IDE.
